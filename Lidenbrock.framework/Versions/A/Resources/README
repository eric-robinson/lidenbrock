Description
===========

Lindenbrock is an add-on to Core Data. It is a solution to easily synchronize your Core Data based application with external JSON data.

Features
==============

* Load new models or synchronize existing ones from a JSON string
* Fetch your data through a single line of code
* Sort your result directly from the predicate format (the SQL way)


Installation
=======

1. git clone git@github.com:sixdegrees/lidenbrock.git
2. Import Lindenbrock.framework to your XCode project
3. Add -ObjC and -all_load to Other Link Flags in your project
4. Include the framework in your code :
#import <Lidenbrock/Lidenbrock.h>


Using Lindenbrock
========

Lindenbrock only uses the default managed object context defined by [YourAppDelegate managedObjectContext], so before using it, make sure this variable is correctly defined.
